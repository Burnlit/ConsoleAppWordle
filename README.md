# ConsoleAppWordle
A fun little project at the beginning of my Microsoft Leap apprenticeship where we recreated a game, for our team we recreated the game Wordle in ConsoleApp.

Wordle: Wordle is a simple online game where the player must guess a random 5 letter word. This one is a valid word. 
The only hint that the player gets is from the letter board 
  The letter is highlighted in yellow if that letter exist in the work.
