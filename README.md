# ConsoleAppWordle
A fun little project at the beginning of my Microsoft Leap apprenticeship where we recreated a game, for our team we recreated the game Wordle in ConsoleApp.

Wordle: Wordle is a simple online game where the player must guess a random 5 letter word. This one is a valid word. 
The only hint that the player gets is from the letter board 
  The letter is highlighted in yellow if that letter exist in the word.
  The letter is highlighted in green if that letter exist and in is the right position in the word.
